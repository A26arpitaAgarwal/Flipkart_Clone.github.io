# Flipkart Clone
This project is a clone of the popular e-commerce platform Flipkart, implemented using HTML and CSS. The project aims to replicate the basic design and layout of the Flipkart website to showcase the front-end web development skills. An ecomerce website for all the products made by Arpita Agarwal using css and html5. It is a responsive layout.
In this layout I have used different images with the help of unsplash API and made different cards for the images for different sliders. 
Added different colors to the headings, and different font styles and a search button too.
